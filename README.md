# Animation Library

I am creating a new repository just for loading and managing animations, because it turned out to be more complicated than I expected. This is heavily based on the animation system in the game "In The Clouds".

To Do List

1. add flame animation around edges.

2. fix keyframes from run animation that need to be removed.

3. sort out what resources are prerequisite.
